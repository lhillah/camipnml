Cami to PNML Converter
============

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/lhillah/camipnml.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/lhillah/camipnml)


This is a model transformation tool that converts Petri nets from the [CPN-AMI's](http://move.lip6.fr/software/CPNAMI/) CAMI format into [Petri Net Markup Language](http://www.pnml.org) ([ISO/IEC 15909-2](http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=43538)) and vice versa. 

Only Place/Transitions nets are surely supported. Symmetric Nets are partially supported (annotations are exported as text and not as AST), with no guarantee.
