Cami to PNML
============

Cami-PNML is a model transformation tool that converts Petri nets in CPN-AMI's CAMI format into PNML (ISO/IEC 1599-2) and vice versa. Only Place/Transitions nets are surely supported. Symmetric Nets are partially supported (annotations are exported as text and not as AST), with no guarantee.
